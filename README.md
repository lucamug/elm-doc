# elm-doc
> `npx elm-doc`

Painfully simple tool for browsing documentation of application dependences
locally.

Listens on port 4040 by default (unless `--port XXXX`) is passed, and tries to
open your browser to point at that page (unless `--closed`) is passed.

Just spin this right up in whatever directory contains your `elm.json` and enjoy!
